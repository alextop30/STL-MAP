# STL-MAP
Implementation and use of C++ Standard Template Library Map

Program is an exercise with the stl container MAP. 

The program is a word counter, it will take text (provided in the input file) and it will read all of the words and find how many times all of the words appear in the input file. The point of the word scanner is to ignore punctuation or other non alpha numeric characters.

The way the program can be run is through the make file by running the command:

make run
